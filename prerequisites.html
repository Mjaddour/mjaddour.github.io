						<h2>
							Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? 
						</h2>
						<p>
							The artifact is a C++ program designed to split input data into tokens and sort prerequisites for courses. This artifact was originally created as part of my CS-300 Data structure and algorithms course, which I completed during the summer of last year.
						</p>
						<h2>
						    Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?	
						</h2>
						<p>
							I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work with algorithms and data structures effectively. Specifically, the artifact highlights my skills in tokenizing strings, implementing sorting algorithms, and managing complex data structures like vectors and maps. The artifact has been improved by enhancing performance through more efficient memory usage, replacing linear search with an unordered map for faster lookups, and optimizing the string tokenization process. 
						</p>
						<h2>
							Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Yes, I met the course outcome. The enhancements made to the artifact allowed me to better understand the importance of time and space complexity when working with large datasets. My outcome-coverage plan remains on track, and no major updates are needed at this point.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 
						</h2>
						<p>
							During the process of enhancing this artifact, I learned the value of algorithm optimization and memory management. I gained deeper insight into the performance benefits of using efficient data structures like “unordered_map” for fast lookups. Additionally, I introduced file open validation to ensure that the program handles file read errors gracefully, preventing the system from crashing if the file is unavailable or corrupt. I also integrated input validation to handle invalid user inputs, ensuring the program remains robust and user-friendly. One of the main challenges I faced was balancing readability and performance, particularly when refactoring code to eliminate unnecessary copies and memory allocations.

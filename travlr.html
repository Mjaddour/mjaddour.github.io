						<h2>
							Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
						</h2>
						<p>
							The artifact is Travlr, a full-stack web application designed to display hotel information, such as the name, rating, and nightly cost. This application was developed as the final project for the CS-465 Full Stack Development I course and was created during the last term.
						</p>
						<h2>
						    Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?	
						</h2>
						<p>
							I included Travlr in my ePortfolio because it showcases my proficiency in both frontend and backend development, specifically in building complete, real-world applications using the MEAN stack method. One of the improvements I made was adding validation to check whether the resortId exists before creating or updating a trip, which ensures data integrity and reduces the risk of errors. Additionally, I enhanced the app by converting the perPerson field from a string to a float using parseFloat, allowing for better calculations and sorting in queries. 
						</p>
						<h2>
							Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Yes, I met the course outcomes by making these database enhancements. The changes specifically aligned with the objectives of designing and optimizing a robust database system for a full-stack application. Implementing validation to ensure the existence of `resortId` and converting `perPerson` to a float improved data accuracy and integrity. These adjustments helped ensure the application can handle database operations more efficiently while preventing inconsistencies.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? 
						</h2>
						<p>
							During the process of enhancing and modifying the Travlr application, I learned the importance of ensuring data consistency and accuracy, particularly when handling external references like resortId and data types such as perPerson. One of the challenges I faced during this enhancement was ensuring that the validation logic for resortId did not introduce delays or break existing functionality. Additionally, modifying the tripsAddTrip and tripsUpdateTrip functions.

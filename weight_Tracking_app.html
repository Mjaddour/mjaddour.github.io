						<h2>
							Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
						</h2>
						<p>
							The artifact is Weight tracking app, a software application developed to allow users to log and monitor their weight overtime. It was created as part of the final project of CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming, the app was developed early this year.
						</p>
						<h2>
						    Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?	
						</h2>
						<p>
							I chose the Weight Tracking app for my eProfolio because it demonstrates a range of software development skills, such as front-end design, back-end development, user authentication, and database integration. <br>
							Enhancing security by implementing adding a special character when sign in, improving the layout to have a dynamic background, change the type of input for quality and Weight to numbers only. 
						</p>
						<h2>
							Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Yes, I met the course outcomes by implementing the CRUD method to the app, and the make sure when the used input verification.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
						</h2>
						<p>
							Throughout the process, I learned the importance of user experience. For example, initially, the app allowed users to accidentally enter a string of words instead of a number for the quantity and weight fields, which negatively impacted the user experience. Fixing this issue was crucial for improving usability. Another challenge I faced was creating functionality that allowed users to update any of their entries in case they made a typo, which further enhanced the app's user experience.
